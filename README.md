# Miniverse

This repository may be configured to directly read an existing Dataverse 4.4+ database.
This read access includes the ability to pull metrics from a Dataverse installation.  

However, the repository was initially created as a way to explore/debug/prototype.

## Functions

- In use:
  - Retrieve basic metrics via API or as visualizations
  - Map visualization of Dataverse affiliations
  - Contributions by [@jcabanas17](https://github.com/jcabanas17), [@emunn](https://github.com/emunn),
- Explore/Prototype
  - Using the Django ORM to explore the Dataverse database, create queries that are later translated to Java code
  - Store cached metadata in JSON documents.   


## Metrics set-up


### Set-up

This describes a set-up with two databases:
  1. An existing Dataverse db in Postgres and credentials to at least read the db tables
    - This Database is unmanaged.  e.g. Django does not update or attempt to update the tables.
    - With proper user credentials, you can edit records via the Django Admin--but **DON'T** do this against a production Dataverse
  2. A database for Django to create tables needed for the map and administration.  
    - This can be any relational db.  (Have used Postgres and sqlite)


### Step 1: Pip install, y'all

This assumes you have installed [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/) and [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/).

- Pull down the miniverse repository
- Install the requirements:

```
# Create a virtualenv
mkvirtualenv miniverse

# cd into the repo
cd miniverse

# install the basic requirements
pip install -r requirements/local.txt
```

### Step 2: Make a settings file

- Create a settings file for a two database set-up.

```
# Make your own settings file: copy "miniverse/settings/local_with_routing_template.py"
#
cp miniverse/settings/local_with_routing_template.py miniverse/settings/local_settings.py
```

- Within your new ```local_settings.py``` file, change the following values:

1. ```SECRET_KEY``` - Set a new secret key value.
  - See: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.9/ref/settings/#secret-key
  - Bad, insecure, but if you must run a local version _on your laptop_: http://www.miniwebtool.com/django-secret-key-generator/
1.  ```DATABASES```
  - Set the ```default``` credentials to a new database for holding the Django/Miniverse apps
  - Set the ```dataverse``` credentials to your existing Dataverse Postgres db
1. Testing database
  - If you are running the Django tests, go to (about) line 135 where it reads ```if 'test' in sys.argv or 'test_coverage' in sys.argv:```
  - Make these changes:
    - Make sure the test db is a Postgres db
    - Make sure the test db user has access to create a database and tables

### Step 3: Make your settings file load when you invoke your virtualenv

- From the top ```miniverse``` project directory, edit this file.  (Note: your virtualenv must be active.)

```
# open with vim
vim $VIRTUAL_ENV/bin/postactivate
# OR open with Atom (or open with anything else)
atom vim $VIRTUAL_ENV/bin/postactivate
```

- Add this line to the bottom of the file:  
  - ```export DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=miniverse.settings.local_settings```
- The _complete_ file, including your line, should be

```
#!/bin/bash
# This hook is run after this virtualenv is activated.
export DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=miniverse.settings.local_settings
```

- Save and close the file
- Type: ```source $VIRTUAL_ENV/bin/postactivate```

- Now, each time you use your virtualenv, Django will know which settings to use

### Step 4: Test your settings and run the dev server

- Type ```python manage.py check```
- If everything looks good, run these lines.  
  - If any provide errors (not warnings),
then re-examine.  
  - You will see a warning related to a "OneToOneField", that's OK

```
python manage.py migrate    # creates needed tables
python manage.py createsuperuser    # create a superuser for yourself
python manage.py collectstatic    # collect your static files
```

See if things are working.  Try this:
```
python manage.py runserver
```

Try these urls:
  - Visualization: http://127.0.0.1:8000/metrics/basic-viz
  - APIs: http://127.0.0.1:8000/static/swagger-ui/index.html


### Step 5: Load map test database

From your virtual env run:

```
python manage.py loaddata dv_apps/installations/fixtures/installations.json
```

If the command above worked, try this url:
  - http://127.0.0.1:8000/map

# Other Setting Notes

## Restricted Django Admin - ```RestrictAdminMiddleware```

Using middleware, the Django Admin access may be restricted to addresses listed in ```settings.INTERNAL_IPS```.

When this middeware is active, users going to Django admin urls who are not coming from an IP listed in ```settings.INTERNAL_IPS``` will receive a 404 error.

- To enable this restriction:
    - In settings.MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES, add: ```dv_apps.admin_restrict.middleware.RestrictAdminMiddleware```
    - Example for ```settings.local_settings``` which is importing from ```settings.base```:

```python
MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES += [
    # Restrict by IP address
    'dv_apps.admin_restrict.middleware.RestrictAdminMiddleware',
]
```

- To add acceptable addresses to ```settings.INTERNAL_IPS```
    - You can add full addresses.  e.g. 211.247.10.10
        - e.g., ```INTERNAL_IPS = ('211.247.10.10',)```
    - You can add the 1st two segments of the address:
        - e.g., ```INTERNAL_IPS = ('140.247', '211.247.10.10',)```
    - You can add the 1st three segments of the address:
        - e.g., ```INTERNAL_IPS = ('140.247.10', '211.247.10.10',)```
    - For running django's test server, the default is:
        - e.g., ```INTERNAL_IPS = ('127.0.0.1',)```

  - Dev note: The code for ```RestrictAdminMiddleware``` is in ```dv_apps/middeware.py```
